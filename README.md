# Healthy-lifestyle-prediction-model.
The dataset contains various factors that contribute to a person's lifestyle. Your task is to build a model that uses these factors to predict whether a person is leading a 'healthy' lifestyle or not. The training set contains 25,920 rows, including whether a person's lifestyle is healthy or not. Use this to train an ML model.
Problem statement :The data contains two files: train.csv and test.csv
1. train.csv - contains the training set observations. 25,920 rows, which have the target variable values as well for training the model.
2. test.csv - contains the testing set observations. 6,480 rows, with the target column missing. Use the trained model to predict and submit the values of the target column.

Additionally, a sample-submission.csv file is provided to show you what your CSV submission should look like. Note that the header has 'predictions' for the column name and the number of rows is equal to the number of rows in the testing set.
